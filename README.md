What You Will Learn
I mentioned previously that I’ll be equipping you with some new tools and techniques. Let’s flesh these out.
InTroduCTIon  Tools
On the tool end of things, we’ll be using the following:
•	JavaScript and the SvJs library. I’ll elaborate on this further later.
•	A code editor. Here I’ll be giving you a choice between
•	Visual Studio Code (an excellent open source code editor)
•	CodePen (a popular online code editor)
•	If you opt to use Visual Studio Code (which I recommend), we’ll also be using Node.js and NPM to manage dependencies (a good habit to get into as a developer).

All code examples are available on both GitHub and CodePen, so feel free to follow along whichever way you prefer. You can of course do both, work locally with a code editor but check out CodePen examples online for quick inspiration. For convenience, I’ll organize and embed all CodePen examples at davidmatthew.ie/generative-art-javascript-svg.

## Techniques
In terms of the techniques we’ll tackle, by the end of this book, you should have a good overview of the following:

•	The main functionality of the SvJs library and how it relates to the SVG spec
•	Creating generative art sketches with JavaScript using ES6+ syntax
•	Generating primitive SVG shapes

## InTroduCTIon
•	Creating iterative variations of sketches by randomizing parameters
•	Using noise to create organic variance
•	Generating complex SVG paths
•	Making sketches interactive
•	Animating sketches
•	Using SVG filters generatively

We’ll be covering a lot of ground, so don’t put yourself under pressure to understand everything. I must have encountered certain programming concepts 
umpteen times before the proverbial penny finally dropped (JavaScript promises anyone?), and whenever understanding did finally dawn, it would usually be because I was experimenting with something I wanted to build, rather than repeating tutorial steps by rote. Tutorials and instructional books certainly have their place (I wouldn’t be writing this book otherwise), but it’s important that you take what you want from them, rather than seeing them as syllabi to be strictly followed.
A sense of play is important, particularly when it comes to art. And although I mentioned tools previously, I would prefer if you viewed this book as more of a toybox than a toolbox. When I think of tools, I think of problems that need fixing, like the loose hinges on that crooked cabinet you’re going to tighten any day now. Tools tend to be more functional than fun, and I’d like you to have some fun with this book.
